# Formation-Attack-Detection-and-Defense
Multi-robot formation control. An attacker attack the formation and the formation can detect the attacker by SVM, then defend the attack by topology transform.
You can run attacker.m or defend.m. I have trained some data to the formation and they are stored in .mat.
